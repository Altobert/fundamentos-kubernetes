You can expect to spend approximately 30-35 hours completing this course. 
You have access to this course for 12 months from the date of registration or until your subscription expires (whichever comes first).

This course is entirely self-paced, with no fixed schedule for completing the material. 
You can complete the course at your own pace, and you will always be returned to exactly where you left off when you return to start a new session.
However, we suggest that you avoid long breaks between periods of work, 
as learning will be faster and content retention will improve.

At the end of each chapter, you will find a series of knowledge check questions. 
These questions were designed with one main goal in mind: 
to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce what you have learned. 
The end-of-chapter knowledge check questions are not graded. 
However, at the end of the course, you will need to complete a final exam and achieve a score of 70%
or higher to complete the course.
